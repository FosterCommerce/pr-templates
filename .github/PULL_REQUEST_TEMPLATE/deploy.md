# Deployment Checklist

## Prepare for deploy
- [ ] Check staging one more time.
- [ ] Recommended: Run end to end tests on the staging site (change baseUrl variable in cypress.json to staging site URL).
- [ ] Make sure it's an okay time to interrupt production (ping the client - are they editing? Did they just send a marketing email?)
- [ ] Back up the production database and make sure you know how to restore (just in case).
- [ ] Make sure you can log into the appropriate Forge account, in case you need to troubleshoot.

## Merge the PR

- [ ] Merge the PR. Forge will deploy the master branch to the production site.

## Quality control & closing
- [ ] Check the production site to make sure the deployment worked and nothing is broken and the new features are working.
- [ ] Maybe run e2e tests on production.
- [ ] Ideally take some screenshots.
- [ ] Move task(s) to the "live on production" list in Basecamp. Assign to whoever is using QA in prod.
